## This Project is developed to give a alternative to wireflow 

# WireTree is inspired by the Wireflow 

#### This project will be available on web with offline support

I will try my best to keep it as simple as possible !

#### Please keep in mind , This project Doesn't share any code base from Wireflow , Wireflow is a very good Project I will try to keep the original  project structure with some more features

#ABOUT PROJECT
i was hoping i could use same graph library as wireflow the library gives too much error and i think has started to break also it has not been Updated in a long time i think it was 4 or 5 year ago last time it was updated my sources were npm and some random webpages
**For that reason** 
#### I have decided to use **_G6**  with nextjs i dont know if it will work or not For now lets just  hope it works,

Also this project is completely open if someone wants to add something or have suggestions i will gladly listen to them, just dont make any useless pull-requests like md or some text
