## i hit a new wall and it sucks i thought reactflow was fully opensource and out of any price plans but its not and fuck now i am back to square one but i think i can implement whole nod edge thing from scratch without using any library but dont know how much time its gonna take so now i dont know what to do at this point idont even want to work on this thing but i have to this is a good project also i have given so much time and days to learning concepts that i will hate it when i quit so from now i am thinking of replacing nextjs to solidjs which is more dom focused instead of serverside rendering and i will be focusing on only dom manipulation god this sucks!!
